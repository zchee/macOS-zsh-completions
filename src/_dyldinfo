# NAME
#      dyldinfo -- Displays information used by dyld in an executable
#
# SYNOPSIS
#      dyldinfo [-arch arch-name] [-dylibs] [-rebase] [-bind] [-weak_bind] [-lazy_bind] [-export] [-opcodes] [-function_starts] file(s)
#
# DESCRIPTION
#      Executables built for Mac OS X 10.6 and later have a new format for the information in the __LINKEDIT segment.  The dyldinfo tool will display that information.

    '-arch[arch Only display the specified architecture]:arch:(x86_64 i386)' \
    '-dylibs[Display the table of dylibs on which this image depends]' \
    '-rebase[Display the table of rebasing information. Rebasing is what dyld does when an image is not loaded at its preferred address. Typically, this involves updating pointers in the __DATA segment which point within the image]' \
    '-bind[Display the table of binding information.  These are the symbolic fix ups that dyld must do when an image is loaded]' \
    '-weak_bind[Display the table of weak binding information.  Typically, only C++ progams will have any weak binding.  These are symbols which dyld must unique accross all images]' \
    '-lazy_bind[Display the table of lazy binding information. These are symbols which dyld delays binding until they are first used.  Lazy binding is automatically used for all function calls to functions in some external dylib]' \
    '-export[Display the table symbols which this image exports]' \
    '-opcodes[Display the low level opcodes used to encode all rebase and binding information]' \
    '-function_starts[Decodes the list of function start addresses]' \
